minor_changes:
  - community.general.telegram - now can call any methods in Telegram bot API.
    Previously this module was hardcoded to use "SendMessage" only.
  - With previous change, usage of "SendMessage" API method was also librated,
    and now you can specify any arguments you need, for example, "disable_notificaton".
